<h2>How it works</h2>

From posting to displaying to editing, akmaljp\\DriveMaru separates its operations in 4 distinct phases:

  * __Configuration__: configure akmaljp\\DriveMaru and the plugins you want to use, or [use a preconfigured bundle](Using_predefined_bundles.md).

  * __Parsing__: the text is parsed and can be stored as an XML document.

  * __Rendering__: the XML document is transformed into HTML.

  * __Unparsing__: the XML document is transformed back into plain text.

```
                Parsing 
              ↗         ↘
Original text             XML → Rendering → HTML
              ↖         ↙
               Unparsing
```

The configurator object can be used to generate a parser object and a renderer object. They can be serialized and should be cached for performance. Preconfigured parsers and renderers are available through bundles.

```
                             $parser
                           ↗    ↕
$configurator → finalize()   (cache)
                           ↘    ↕
                             $renderer
```

The parser object transforms plain text into XML, the renderer object transforms XML into HTML. The XML can be reverted back to the original text using the `akmaljp\DriveMaru\Unparser::unparse()` static method. This is done without losing or modifying any content. *(apart from a few [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character) such as NUL bytes)*

```
        $parser->parse()
      ↗                  ↘
$text                      $xml → $renderer->render() → $html
      ↖                  ↙
       Unparser::unparse()
```
